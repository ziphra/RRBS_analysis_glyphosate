Bismark report for: ./trimmed_200022_98_58B_S18_L1L2_R1_001/200022_98_58B_S18_L1L2_R1_001_trimmed.fq (version: v0.22.3)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /scratch/project_2003821/RGQMA/RGQMA1/refgen/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	52809711
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	22874101
Mapping efficiency:	43.3%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	24467754
Sequences did not map uniquely:	5467856
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	257

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
