Bismark report for: ./trimmed_200022_55_29B_S15_L001_R1_001/200022_55_29B_S15_L001_R1_001_trimmed.fq (version: v0.22.3)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /scratch/project_2003821/RGQMA/RGQMA1/refgen/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	38290033
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	16713858
Mapping efficiency:	43.7%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	17634128
Sequences did not map uniquely:	3942047
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	206

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	8284704	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	8428948	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
