- differentially methylated sites in 7 weeks female seems to recovers at 12
- these sites seems not to be impacted for male 


## differentially methylated sites in 7 weeks males

- almost same absolute difference between 1.M/2.M and 1.F/2.F but we're looking at differentially methylated sites in male at 7 weeks
- These sites seems to be impacted the same way across conditions.

- glyphosate at 12 months in female prevented some sites to be methylated?
