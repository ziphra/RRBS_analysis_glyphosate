# Sites correction 
## p-value correction

Sites with no difference in methylation means seemed to have by mistake been labeled as significant sites, like the CpGs in the gene NFIC:   
![](../img/nfic.png) 

Sites issued with convergence warnings have either a p-value = 0, and were removed in the pipeline, but others have just very low p-values that were not discared. 

Sites issued with warnings were then all discared. See [warningsites.rmd](warningsites.rmd) and [warning12.rmd](./warning12.rmd).

## intersection 

**!!** GFF starts and ends are one-based.
In contrast, the GFF format uses 1-based coordinates for both the start and the end positions. bedtools is aware of this and adjusts the positions accordingly. In other words, you donâ€™t need to subtract 1 from the start positions of your GFF features for them to work correctly with bedtools.
