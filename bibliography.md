- It is known that epigenetic factors are able to target specific cells or tissues or are only active during certain develop- mental stages 
- epigenetic mechanisms may provide an organism with the opportunity for an adaptive response to a change in the envi- ronment via phenotypic plasticity

##### Epigenetic marks in birds
what is the origin of this variation, and what are the consequences of this for selection ?  

- First, epigenetic variation might originate from environmental induction. This can either be dependent on stochastic events (such as random error) or environmental cues
	- To what extent this induced variation (1) stably inherits via mitosis from cell to cell, or may even be inherited across multiple generations, or (2) whether it is completely erased after meiosis, still needs to be investigated in birds.  
	- This epigenetic variation could potentially be either inherited over one or more generations or, when it is not inherited, may contribute to natural selection within that generation, but will not affect the evolution of the expressed phenotype.
- The second source is *epimutations*
- The third origin of epigenetic variation is when changes in methylation completely depend on some underlying genetic variation, which is termed ‘obligatory epigenetic variation’
- Cytosine methylation in birds can occur in three different sequences: CpG, CHG or CHH
	- it is unknown whether non-CpG methylation is brain specific or whether it also occurs in other tissues.
- A whole genome DNA methylation sequence assembly for both brain and blood tissue in the Great Tit in combination with RNAseq gene expression data showed that DNA methylation around a gene’s transcription start site negatively correlates with gene expression, whereas genes with promoters that were highly methylated showed lower expression levels 

##### Different techniques for measuring DNA methylation
###### Bisulphite sequencing
- affects only cytosine that is not methylated
- RRBS is a method whereby the restriction enzyme MspI cuts at (CCGG) sites, and typically regions that are CG rich are targeted. This enables one to aim for a higher proportion of sequenced CpG sites in CGIs, such as promoter regions

##### Early developmental effects
- maternal exposure to stressors can impact offspring methylation perhaps through the deposition of steroid hormones in the yolk.  it is possible that the females “prepared” their chicks for high- density conditions (high competition) through testosterone allocation, which instigated changes in DNA methylation
- DNA methylation marks established early in life may still influence adult behaviour
- Brood size may influence DNA methylation

##### Role of epigenetics in regulating the timing of reproduction
- Phenotypic plasticity in the timing of reproduction allows a female to seasonally express reproductive morphology and behaviour in response to changes in environmental cues such as photoperiod and temperature
- epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, could be involved

- it is not yet clear to what extent observed DNA methylation patterns in blood correlate with methylation patterns in other (reproductive) tissues

#### Evolutionary conservation of CGIs
- Some inverterbrate and fungus have no methylated CpG => CpG occures at the expected frequency. 
- most invertebrate animals exhibit mosaically methylated genomes comprising alternating methylated and nonmethylated domains 
- The origin of vertebrates appears to have coincided with a transition from mosaic to global DNA methylation, accompanied by concomitant CpG depletion throughout most of the genome 

##### CGIs are sites of transcriptional initiation
- Half of CpG islands occurs at TSS sites. 
- "Orphan" CpGi 
	- often happen to be site of transcription initiation.
	- Others may initiate ncRNAs that regulate gene expression.
- (1) CGIs are evolutionary footprints of molecular events that occur at many eukaryotic promoters, but are only visible in organisms that have extensive genomic DNA methylation; or (2) CGIs are important regulatory structures that have evolved under selection in genomes where DNA methylation plays a regulatory role.

##### Characteristics of CGI promoters
###### DNA Sequence motifs
- CGI are often colocalize with promoters
- No focused TSS when CGI but dispersed initiation pattern 
- CGI promoters are transcriptionally permissive  
...

##### The chromatin signature of CGIs
###### Unstable nucleosome
- There is evidence that nonmethylated CGIs are organized in a characteristic chromatin structure that predisposes them toward promoter activity => nucleosome deficiency => DNA in CGI chromatin is direcly accessible


##### What protects CGIs from DNA methylation?
- hundreds of CGIs are heavily methylated on one female X chromosome, but are non- methylated on the other.
- CGIs are intrinsically refractory to the action of DNA methyltransferases ? => Unlikely
- Maybe methylation at CGIs is actively removed by a DNA demethylase
- The methylation-free state of CGIs is causally related to their function as promoters

- RRBS utilizes the cutting pattern of MspI (C^CGG) to systematically digest DNA to enrich for CpG dinucleotides : every fragment produced by MspI digestion will contain DNA methylation information for at least one CpG dinucleotide
- In the standard protocole, size selection of sequence fragments is done by gel electrophoresis (40 to 220 bp)
- in the new protocole, fragments < 40bp are removed by a simple wash, and PCR and illumina seq prevent larger fragment (how?)
- multiplexing samples
- allows to make 96 libraries using 8 lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer with 12 libraries per lane,
- Results are comparable to those obtained by RRBS
- Less expensive and faster
