# methylKit 
methylKit is an R package for analysis and annotation of DNA methylation information obtained by high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. See [user guide](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/methylKit/inst/doc/methylKit.html#22_Reading_the_methylation_call_files_and_store_them_as_flat_file_database)

### Data preparation 
- First I need to get all the `zero.cov` files in the `meth` directories (the methylation extraction output directory) with ```for folder in `cat allfolders.txt`; do cp ./${folder}/meth_${folder}/*zero.cov cov_files;done```, and store their names and all associated information (batch number, age, control or glyphosate) in a tab file for later use in methylKit. See the script to do so [here](./cov_tab.sh). I get a tab file (sampleID.csv) with `<file>	<cond>	<age>` and added a last column `<batch>` by hands through Numbers.

The coverage output looks like this:
`<chromosome> <start position> <end position> <methylation percentage> <count methylated> <count unmethylated>`

- File names and samples ID must be different
	- I used the function TEXTBETWEEN in Numbers to get rid of the identical left and right parts of each file names, and saved the file as csv for later use in R. Now the csv file is composed of 5 colums `<file>	<cond>	<age>	<name>	<sex>`.
	- To add the sex of each samples in my csv, using Suvi's excel sheet, see python [script](nameToSex).


Followed the same process after having concatenated the 2 differents lanes of each samples in batch 5.

### Workflow summary

1. **Basic**
	1. Read the methylation call (.cov files obtained through bismark methylation extraction) and make a flat db 

	2. Filtering samples based on read coverage: discard base with low coverage, to get rid of PCR mistakes, but also discard bases with very high coverage that could result from PCR bias. 

2. **Comparative analysis**
	1. Merge all samples for futher analysis: a new object is built containing methylation information for regions/bases that are covered in all samples
	
	2. A look at **correlation between samples** 

	
	3. **Clustering samples** 
	![](../img/meth_clustering_plot_12_7.png)
		
	4. **PCA analysis** on samples (see `PCA_screeplot_12_7.pdf`, 
	`PCA_scatter_plot_12_7.pdf`,`PCA_meth_plot.pdf`). PCA is an unsupervised method used to explore the data variance structure by reducing its dimensions to a few principal components (PC) that explain the greatest variation in the data.

	![](../img/PCA_scatter_plot_12_7.png)

	5. **Batch effect**: check which one of the principal components are statistically associated with a potential batch effects. Can also be used to see if an other variable has an effect on the methylation.

	
	6. **Finding differentially methylated bases or regions**: it will either use Fisherâ€™s exact or logistic regression to calculate P-values.
